/**
 * Uninstall cleanup for Oversio Agent Abilities — multisite-aware.
 *
 * Removes only this plugin's own data: every configuration option, the detected-meta-keys
 * transient, the per-site activity log table, and the OAuth tables. On multisite it loops
 * every blog so nothing is left behind. No other plugin's data is touched.
 *
 * Intentionally left in place: the dedicated agent WordPress user the plugin can create and
 * any application passwords issued to it. That user is a first-class WordPress account the
 * operator may have repurposed or assigned other roles, so deleting it (and silently revoking
 * its credentials) on uninstall would be destructive and surprising. Removing the account is
 * the operator's call, made from the Users screen.
