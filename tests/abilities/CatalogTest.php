 * misnamed, miscategorized, registered without a closed input_schema / required
 * output_schema / permission_callback, or carries a dishonest readonly/destructive
 * annotation, this test fails loudly here rather than letting the gap reach the
 * MCP server. It is the proof that the reads + writes catalog holds with no drift.
