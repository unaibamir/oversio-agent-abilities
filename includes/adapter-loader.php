/**
 * Eager-load our bundled wordpress/mcp-adapter copy to win the WP\MCP\ class-declaration race.
 *
 * The wordpress/mcp-adapter library is bundled by multiple plugins, all under the shared
 * WP\MCP\ namespace. PHP can hold only one WP\MCP\Core\McpAdapter declaration per request, so
 * whichever plugin's autoloader declares it first wins for the whole site. A plugin shipping an
 * older copy via a plain Composer autoloader (confirmed: Rank Math SEO bundles 0.4.1) can win
 * that race, and our floor check then rejects the loaded version — so our /mcp route never
 * registers (site-wide 404 for our endpoint).
 *
 * Our copy is 0.5.0 and we MUST run it: 0.4.1 lacks the mcp_adapter_tools_list filter, our
 * request-time per-connection capability gate, so running on it would be a silent security
 * regression. The public McpAdapter API is identical between 0.4.1 and 0.5.0 and 0.5.0 is an
 * additive superset, so forcing our 0.5.0 to be the loaded copy is API-safe for other plugins.
 *
 * The fix: register a PREPENDED autoloader for the WP\MCP\ namespace, resolving from our bundled
 * copy, at the plugin file's top level. Because plugin folders load alphabetically and we sort
 * first as "agent-abilities-for-mcp", this runs before any sibling's autoloader is even loaded;
 * McpAdapter is a final class with no declaration-time dependencies, so eager resolution is clean.
 *
 * MAINTENANCE: when the bundled wordpress/mcp-adapter is updated, re-verify
 * aafm_adapter_namespace_map() against each bundled package's composer.json PSR-4 map (the adapter
 * AND the php-mcp-schema package it depends on), and re-check the /includes/Cli/ skip in
 * aafm_eager_load_adapter() — confirm it still covers the WP-CLI-only classes, and whether any new
 * runtime-only directory needs the same skip treatment.

 * Eager-load every class in our bundled adapter copy, declaring them before any sibling can.

 * A prepended autoloader cannot reliably win the WP\MCP\ class-declaration race: each

 * first reference to WP\MCP\Core\McpAdapter can resolve to a sibling's older copy (confirmed:
 * Rank Math SEO bundles 0.4.1). PHP, however, allows only ONE declaration of a class per
 * request. Because plugin folders load alphabetically and we sort first as
 * "agent-abilities-for-mcp", our main file runs before any conflicting sibling's file. Declaring
 * all of our 0.5.0 WP\MCP\ classes here, during our plugin-include phase, makes PHP commit to our
 * copy; a later sibling that references the same class then transparently uses ours. The public
 * McpAdapter API is identical across 0.4.1 and 0.5.0 (0.5.0 is an additive superset), so a
 * 0.4.1-expecting consumer keeps working — and we keep the per-connection capability gate that
 * 0.4.1 lacks.
 *
 * One recursive require_once pass is sufficient: if a class file references a not-yet-declared
 * WP\MCP\ interface or trait, the prepended autoloader registered above resolves it from our
 * bundle (it is the only WP\MCP\ autoloader active this early, so no foreign copy can intercept).
 *
 * The Cli/ subdirectory is skipped on purpose: McpCommand extends \WP_CLI_Command, which does not
 * exist outside a WP-CLI request, so declaring it here would fatal. Those classes are never used
 * by the REST /mcp path.
 *
 * Cost is negligible: aafm_init_mcp() already calls McpAdapter::instance() on every request, which
 * loads the adapter anyway — eager-loading the remaining sibling classes in the same phase adds
 * only a handful of require_once calls on already-bundled files.
 *
 * Inverse-version trade: this override is version-agnostic — it forces ANY later-loading sibling
 * (older OR newer copy) onto our 0.5.0, since PHP commits to whichever copy is declared first. The
 * floor/upper-bound check and "too old"/"too new" notices in bootstrap.php are the fallback for the
