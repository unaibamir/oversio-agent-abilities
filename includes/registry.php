 *
 * - `oversio_abilities_registry` (filter): add a row to the live, host-gated catalog. Each row is
 *   keyed by ability name (e.g. 'oversio/get-posts') and carries the UI/registration metadata plus
 *   an 'args' builder. Rows added here register as real abilities and appear in the admin UI.
 *   Applied in oversio_get_abilities_registry().
 *
 * - `oversio_abilities_registry_integrations` (filter): add integration rows UNCONDITIONALLY (no
 *   host-active guard) so the Integrations tab and the manifest can enumerate an integration even
 *   when its host plugin is inactive. These rows feed the full catalog view only, never the
 *   registration walk. Applied in oversio_get_abilities_registry_full().
 *
 * Both filters receive an array keyed by ability name and must return the same shape. Domain and
 * integration files in includes/abilities/ are the in-tree examples of registering against them.

 * The full catalog of available abilities, INCLUDING integration rows whose host plugin is inactive.
 *
 * The live oversio_get_abilities_registry() is host-gated: an integration contributes its rows only
 * while its host plugin is active, so on a site without WooCommerce the live registry has no
 * WC rows. That gating is correct for registration — actual wp_register_ability() must only fire for
 * active hosts — but the catalog still "counts" inactive integrations, and the Integrations tab and
 * the manifest need every integration's label/description even when its host is off.
 *
 * This view answers that need WITHOUT touching the registration path. It starts from the live
 * registry, then overlays every integration's definitions from the unguarded
 * 'oversio_abilities_registry_integrations' filter — each integration file contributes its rows there
 * with NO host guard. For an active host the overlay is identical to what the live registry already
 * holds; for an inactive host it adds the rows the guard withheld. The registration walk
 * (oversio_register_enabled_abilities()) reads oversio_get_abilities_registry(), never this, so an inactive
 * host still exposes zero tools.
 *
 * Memoized per request and flushed by the same oversio_flush_registry_cache() flag as the live registry,
 * so host-toggling tests stay consistent across both views.
