 * The live aafm_get_abilities_registry() is host-gated: an integration contributes its rows only
 * while its host plugin is active, so on a site without WooCommerce the live registry has no
 * WC rows. That gating is correct for registration — actual wp_register_ability() must only fire for
 * active hosts — but the catalog still "counts" inactive integrations, and the Integrations tab and
 * the manifest need every integration's label/description even when its host is off.
 *
 * This view answers that need WITHOUT touching the registration path. It starts from the live
 * registry, then overlays every integration's definitions from the unguarded
 * 'aafm_abilities_registry_integrations' filter — each integration file contributes its rows there
 * with NO host guard. For an active host the overlay is identical to what the live registry already
 * holds; for an inactive host it adds the rows the guard withheld. The registration walk
 * (aafm_register_enabled_abilities()) reads aafm_get_abilities_registry(), never this, so an inactive
 * host still exposes zero tools.
 *
 * Memoized per request and flushed by the same aafm_flush_registry_cache() flag as the live registry,
 * so host-toggling tests stay consistent across both views.
