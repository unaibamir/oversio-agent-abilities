 * installed. This hand-maintained manifest holds those totals independent of host activation, so
 * an Integrations card for an inactive host can still show "0 / 67". It is the single count
 * contract for the integration surface, alongside aafm_available_ability_count() for the whole
 * catalog.
 *
 * KEEP IN LOCKSTEP WITH THE CATALOG. These numbers are NOT derived from the registry (that is the
 * point — they must hold when the host is inactive). The IntegrationManifestTest drift catcher
 * asserts that the manifest's per-slug totals, summed with the core (non-integration) count,
 * equal the catalog-lock total when every host is force-active. If you add or remove an
 * integration ability, update both the registry AND the matching slug here, or that test fails.
